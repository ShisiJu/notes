# 数据库索引 - 全文索引

The above are all simple text search examples. As mentioned before, full text search functionality
includes the ability to do many more things: 

skip indexing certain words (stop words)
process synonyms
use sophisticated parsing,
 e.g., parse based on more than just white space. This
functionality is controlled by text search configurations. PostgreSQL comes with predefined
configurations for many languages, and you can easily create your own configurations. (psql's \dF
command shows all available configurations.)







To implement full text searching there must be a function to create a tsvector from a document
and a tsquery from a user query. Also, we need to return results in a useful order, so we need a
function that compares documents with respect to their relevance to the query. It's also important to
be able to display the results nicely. PostgreSQL provides support for all of these functions.
